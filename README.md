<b> Check Your Understanding Questions:</b>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>You would fit your automated tests within a Github action that runs  
	whenever code is pushed so that the code is regularly tested in a fast and
	efficient manner compared to manual testing. It also ensure that all code
	will be tested after every push. 
	</li>
	<li>No, you wouldn't use an end-to-end test to check if a function is 
	returning the correct output.
	</li>
	<li>No, you wouldn't use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a 
	messaging application because this entail taking in various features that work
	together to display it to the user which makes it complex to do. It is 
	better to use a end-to-end test </li>
	<li>Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of 
	a messaging application because testing the input does not require much work 
	since it's a single function. 
	</li>
